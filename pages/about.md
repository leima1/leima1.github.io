Hi! I am a neuroscience researcher and physical therapist. I use virtual reality, motion capture, and surface and intracranial EEG recordings to study how the brain resolves sensory and motor deficits. I aim to bridge the gap between clinical practice and basic science to improve the functions of patients with movement disorders.
